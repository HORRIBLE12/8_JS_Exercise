# JavaScript Function

## Article Section

Functions are like **building blocks** in JavaScript.

A **function declaration** uses the keyword **function**.

Here's an example of a function:
```
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```

The **function** keyword goes first, then goes the *name of the function*.

Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use".

They are executed later, when they are invoked (called upon), like this: `functionName()`


## DIY Section

- Create a function called `myFunction`
- Inside the function `myFunction`, print `"Hello World!"` with a `console.log()`
